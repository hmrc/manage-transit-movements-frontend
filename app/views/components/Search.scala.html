<!-- There is no search component in play-frontend-hmrc, but there is one on the MOJ design system.
https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/components/search/
However, it doesn't integrate well with an error summary and has known accessibility issues.
If these issues get addressed we could look to migrate to using that component at a later date.
There is also guidance however that we should "Align the primary action button to the left edge of your form.", which the MOJ component doesn't currently do.
